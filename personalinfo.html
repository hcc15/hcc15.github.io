    	       My name is Hamza Caner CANBAZ. I am trying to study computer science at Anadolu University. I joined Erasmus+ program last year and after that I totally lost my interest to my department. What a shame. However this situation push me the other options and I can say I am a parttime actor and trying to be real actor who is act in films or series. I hope you will see me on TV soon. :).
             <br><img src=img/mainpagephoto/photo4.jpg alt="photo4" width=300px> Here is the one photo from my fisrt series that I act.
    	       <br>Anyway let's talk about Erasmus+. I live in Lublin Poland for 1 year and it was definitely my best year. Those travels that I made last year and friendships that I gained last year were the best present from past me to future me. I saw the Europe and learn diffirent culture. I suggest everyone to get ecperience like this.</br>
